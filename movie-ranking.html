<h1>The Best Movies According To Tati</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<h3>The 5 Heartbeats</h3>
<p>This movie combines so many of the issues that my culture faces, but also teaches you about what those mistakes can do to you. It also shows you just how your mistakes can causes harm to you as well as those around you. It also teaches you about love and making your dreams come true, no matter where you come from or who you are. You can be a Star too.</p>

<h3>Enough</h3>
<p>I believe that this is one of Jenifer Lopez best movies because of the trials she faced. She fell in love with the wrong guy and enjoyed her life for a very long time, just to find out that he isn't who she thinks he is. She found a way to free herself and her daughter from the toxic and dangerous behavior of this man.</p>

<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful movie about a girl becoming the person she wants to be regardless of status. She enjoyed her summer and learned some new moves and fell in love with a great guy. She found herself and she found a talent that she didn't know that she had.</p>
