<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello & Welcome To My Portfolio Website</p>

<p>My Name is Tatiana Kendrix. I am like everyone else in this world trying to find my place where I belong and what my purpose in life is. I do believe that my purpose is to be a blessing to my community and anyone that I may come in contact with. I strive to first be a daughter of the most high... Yahweh. I understand that some like to keep their beliefs under wraps but I refuse to deny my father anywhere. I am currently on a journey of Web Development & Coding. Computers is something that I was always good at but God told me to give it my all. 
</p>

<p>Now that you know me personally let's discuss professional. I am a Tech Savvy Person who loves to design with Technology. If you have something you are selling that needs labels, personal or family event(Creating Awards), or business website you need created by scratch or shopify... I am willing to be that help hand. I want to be a help to my community as well as my own family. Learning and honing in on great skills and courses that will allow me to do and be just that.
